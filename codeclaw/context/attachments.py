"""
Attachment auto-injection system.

Generates contextual attachments that are injected as system-reminder
messages before each model turn. Mirrors Claude Code's utils/attachments.ts.

Attachment types:
  - file_change_delta: diffs of files modified since last turn
  - plan_mode_reminder: plan mode workflow instructions
  - todo_reminder: nudge to use todo_write_tool for complex tasks
  - agent_listing: available agent types for agent_tool
  - diagnostics: compiler/linter warnings from LSP
  - skill_recommendation: auto-surfaced relevant skills
