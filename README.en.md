# Xuloom

A local, general-purpose agent workbench with a desktop app and CLI sharing one Python engine. Connect your own model; use Skills for reusable workflows, Subagents for delegation, and MCP for external tools.

[中文](README.md) · [Windows downloads](https://github.com/Dheudb/xuloom/releases) · [Documentation](docs/README.md)

## Start here

Download the Windows x64 ZIP from Releases, extract the whole directory, and run `Xuloom.exe`. Keep its `resources` directory; GitHub's Source code archive is not the app. The portable package includes Python and the MCP SDK. You do not need to choose an interpreter or install Node.js for the app itself.

Open **Settings → Model connections**, enter your API endpoint, protocol, model ID and key. A connection can list multiple models; multiple providers are supported. OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions and Anthropic Messages are supported. Local model servers must expose a supported interface. Text completion alone does not establish compatibility with tools or images.

Choose **New conversation** to get an independent working directory, or open an existing folder. A Git repository is not required. The current version is **v0.1.0**; macOS/Linux desktop distributions are not available.

Execution traces use compact rows with icons for images, edits, terminal commands and searches. Expand a row for its inputs and output; completed turns collapse automatically. Image reads show clickable thumbnails backed by session snapshots, so previews survive changes or deletion of the original file. Previewing does not call a model; model image understanding requires an endpoint supporting image input.

## Configure extensions in Settings

Open a conversation first; extension management does not require a model API call.

| Settings page | Actions |
| --- | --- |
| Skills | Create a skill, import an existing directory, refresh, inspect instructions, open configuration folders |
| Subagents | Create a role, set its model/tools/skills, import definitions, inspect instructions |
| MCP services | Open the existing MCP manager for marketplace browsing, custom configuration, testing and enable/disable |

New Skill/Subagent definitions can be global or local to the current workspace. They are real Markdown files, outside the EXE. Imported directories are mounted in place, not copied. Keep the original directory available. Existing files are never overwritten by the creation form.

## Skills

Place one skill in `<workspace>/.xuloom/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`, or `~/.xuloom/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` for all workspaces:

```markdown
---
name: literature-review
description: Compare primary research on a specified topic and cite sources.
---
Clarify the research scope. Find original sources, distinguish evidence from
inference, compare findings, and provide clickable citations.
```

The name must match the directory: lowercase letters, digits and single hyphens, at most 64 characters. Optional `references/`, `scripts/` and `assets/` live alongside `SKILL.md`.

Type `$` in the composer to select valid skills, then write your request. Skills are available by default and do not grant additional permissions. Public built-ins: `code-development`, `code-review`, `debug-issue`, `web-research`, `skill-creator`, `data-analysis`, `document-writing`, `document-summary`, `experiment-design`.

## Subagents

Place definitions in `<workspace>/.xuloom/agents/` or `~/.xuloom/agents/`. For example, `source-checker.md`:

```markdown
---
name: source-checker
description: Independently check evidence in supplied materials.
model: inherit
tools: Read, Grep, Glob, Skill
skills: [literature-review]
---
Check the assigned claims. Report supported, unsupported and contradictory
statements with sources. Do not modify files.
```

Install the referenced skill first. `model: inherit` uses the current model; another model ID must belong to the same API connection. Omit `tools` to inherit available tools, or use `tools: []` in a manual definition to provide none. Tool aliases include Read, Write, Edit, Exec, Grep, Glob and Skill.

Assign tasks through the Agents panel or name the role in your request. Creating a definition does not launch it. Workers have independent contexts but share workspace files and remain subject to permissions and budgets. Solo disables delegation; Auto delegates when useful; Ultra actively looks for useful parallel work. Auto and Ultra differ only in delegation initiative, with no default concurrency, total-worker or shared-output quota. Explicit host limits apply equally to both; accepted work queues automatically when a finite concurrency is configured.

## MCP

Go to **Settings → MCP services → Open MCP manager**. Choose a catalog entry or add a custom service. Local stdio services need a command, argument array and optional environment variables. Remote Streamable HTTP services need a URL and optional headers.

Save, test the connection, then explicitly enable the service. Installation saves a disabled configuration. Testing starts the program or accesses the remote service; it does not call the chat model.

Workspace configuration is `<workspace>/.xuloom/mcp_servers.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "local-files": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "C:/allowed-folder"],
      "env": {},
      "enabled": false
    }
  }
}
```

This example needs Node.js/npm and a real allowed directory. Remote services use `type: "http"`, `url`, and `headers`. Keep credentials in headers/environment rather than visible command arguments. Use trusted services. OAuth and legacy SSE are not implemented. Windows system execution isolation disables MCP.

## Data, permissions and limits

Model connections live in `~/.xuloom/config.json`; global extensions in `~/.xuloom/skills/` and `~/.xuloom/agents/`. Workspace configuration lives in `.xuloom/`; chat history is centralized outside workspaces. Windows data uses `%LOCALAPPDATA%/Xuloom`, Linux uses `$XDG_DATA_HOME/xuloom` or `~/.local/share/xuloom`, and macOS uses `~/Library/Application Support/Xuloom`.

Desktop and CLI share storage with a single-writer session lock, not live collaborative editing. Moving a conversation to a project changes its future working directory without moving its old files.

Ask for approval and Full access govern tool authorization. Neither is an OS sandbox. Optional Windows x64 LPAC execution isolation is available from the composer's plus menu; Git worktrees/copies only isolate file changes. See the documented restrictions before using it.

The plus menu also selects goal mode: write a goal as your next prompt, then manage the persistent strip. Model completion claims do not establish domain acceptance. Automatic updates, signed installers and macOS/Linux desktop packages remain unavailable. Real long-task and cross-platform validation remains ongoing.

Private skills, credentials and chat histories are not part of the public distribution. Model and external tool calls still send their supplied task content to the configured service.

## Source development and CLI

Recommended: Python 3.12+, Node.js 24+, Git and ripgrep (`rg`). Base CLI supports Python 3.9+; MCP needs Python 3.10+.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dheudb/xuloom.git
cd xuloom
python -m venv .venv
# Activate .venv, then:
python -m pip install -e ".[mcp]"
xuloom
# Non-interactive execution:
xuloom exec "Your task" --cwd /path/to/work --json
# Desktop development:
cd desktop
npm ci
npm run dev
```
